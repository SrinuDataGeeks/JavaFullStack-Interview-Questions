				RESTFul Services ?
				****************

1.** What is the diff b/w Restful & SOAP Services ?

2.How can we implement Restful Services with SpringBoot?

3.What is diff between Collection URI's and Instance Based URI ?

4.*** What are the rules to follow to develop good Restful services ?
	=> Every request has to be athenticated. Can be implemented through API gateways.
	=> Service Exchange between consumer and producer should happen only thorugh json.
	=> Every request has to be differentiated with Http Methods.
	=> Define proper Collection based & Instance based Resource URI's.
	=> Every response from the producer should include valid Http Response Code.
	=> Good Restful service should implement HATEOAS .
	nextResources : {
			getById : http://localhost:8099/employees/1242/
			getEmpRoles: http://localhost:8099/employees/1242/roles
		   	}
	HATEOAS is a next level rest api , where we include the next rest uris related to the resource with the in the response.So that the consumer should not refer any external documents to know about the api.
	=> To the consumer Service Definition should be exposed through swagger ui.
	
5.*** What is the diff between PUT and POST methods ?

6.*** Can we use @PutMapping for saving record ? No

7.*** What is PatchMapping? how can we implement?

6. *** What is Service Agregation ?
	
	Assume for a perticular request multiple restful services has to be invoked and  the response to be customized from multiple restful services.
	At this perticuler case we expose common rest uri to the consumer, when cosumer makes a call which can invoke diff restful services , finally we agregate the response from different restful services then forward the agregated results to the consumer.This process is called Service Agregation.

	=> In Plain Restful environment the ServiceAgregation can be possible through RestTemplate.
	=> In a MicroService environment the ServiceAgregation can be possible through FeignClient.
